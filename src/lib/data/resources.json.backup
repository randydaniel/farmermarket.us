		"longDescription": "<p>The Missoula Farmers Market holds the distinction of being Montana's original farmers market, established as a non-profit corporation on June 7, 1972, with the first market held on July 21, 1972. Founded by visionaries Mavis McKelvey and Chinwon Reinhardt, this historic market has been 'a gathering of food and friends since 1972' and is celebrating its remarkable 53rd season in 2025. Located on East Railroad Street west of Pattee Street, where it has operated continuously since its founding, the market runs Saturday mornings from 8 AM to 12:30 PM and Tuesday evenings from 5:30 PM to 7 PM. Originally created as an outlet for local farmers and gardeners to sell their produce in a part of town that was largely forgotten, the market's popularity has grown tremendously over the decades. The city has invested in improvements including doubling the market space by moving the locomotive, creating the central plaza, and adding lighting and brickwork for ambience. The success of the Missoula Farmers Market has been so significant that it sparked the creation of additional markets including the People's Market and the Clark Fork River Market, cementing its role as the cornerstone of Missoula's vibrant local food scene.</p>",

Harden negotiated with the city to create what remains today as the Farmers Public Market. Officially opened on June 16, 1928, this historic 40,000 square foot building was constructed on the former site of the Delmar Gardens Amusement Park to resolve the ongoing conflict between local farmers and downtown businessmen over street congestion caused by farmers selling produce from trucks and wagons on downtown streets.</p><p>In its heyday, the building featured a downstairs market where farmers sold fresh produce and an upstairs Market Garden Ballroom that hosted concerts, dances, boxing matches, and roller-skating. The comprehensive facility also housed a meat market, candy store, bakery, café, and drug store, making it a true community hub. Under the stewardship of Burt and Jody McAnally for over 20 years, the market has blossomed into an ever-dynamic and expanding community environment with growing economic opportunities for new businesses and local vendors.</p><p>Today's Saturday Farmers Market creates a space that connects Oklahoma farmers and ranchers with the general shopping public, while the facility has also evolved into a premier wedding and event venue, winning multiple awards over the years. The market continues to honor its original mission of providing a centralized marketplace for local agricultural products while adapting to serve the modern community's diverse needs through its combination of fresh food access, cultural events, and economic development opportunities.</p>",

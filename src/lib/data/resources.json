Officially opened on June 16, 1928, this historic 40,000 square foot building was constructed on the former site of the Delmar Gardens Amusement Park to resolve the ongoing conflict between local farmers and downtown businessmen over street congestion caused by farmers selling produce from trucks and wagons on downtown streets.</p><p>In its heyday, the building featured a downstairs market where farmers sold fresh produce and an upstairs Market Garden Ballroom that hosted concerts, dances, boxing matches, and roller-skating. The comprehensive facility also housed a meat market, candy store, bakery, café, and drug store, making it a true community hub. Under the stewardship of Burt and Jody McAnally for over 20 years, the market has blossomed into an ever-dynamic and expanding community environment with growing economic opportunities for new businesses and local vendors.</p><p>Today's Saturday Farmers Market creates a space that connects Oklahoma farmers and ranchers with the general shopping public, while the facility has also evolved into a premier wedding and event venue, winning multiple awards over the years. The market continues to honor its original mission of providing a centralized marketplace for local agricultural products while adapting to serve the modern community's diverse needs through its combination of fresh food access, cultural events, and economic development opportunities.</p>",
